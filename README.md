**ULMEvalKit** (Python package: **ulmeval**) is an open-source evaluation toolkit on **generation benchmarks** for **unified understanding & generation models (ULMs) and generative models**. It enables **one-command evaluation** of ULMs on various generation benchmarks, eliminating the heavy workload of data preparation across multiple repositories.

**Key Features:**
- Currently supports text-to-image and image-text-to-image generation tasks
- Distributed inference and evaluation support
- Flexible evaluation with both local models (CLIP, Mask2Former) and API models (GPT-4o)

## 🆕 News

- **[2025-10-09]** 🚀🚀🚀 Release **ULMEvalKit v0.1**. Contributions are welcomed!

## 🏗️ QuickStart

See [[QuickStart](/docs/en/Quickstart.md)] for a quick start guide.

## 📊 Datasets, Models, and Evaluation Results

### Supported Models and Benchmarks

**Supported models:** BAGEL, FLUX.1, Janus-Pro,....

**Supported benchmarks:** GenEval, DPG-Bench, T2I-CompBench,....

See **full list** in [[Supported models and benchmarks](/docs/envs/README.md)].

We are continuously adding new models and benchmarks! If you are interested in contributing a new model or benchmark, see [Development](#%EF%B8%8F-development-guide) for details.

### Evaluation Results

**👣 Performance numbers of ULMs are on the way.**

### Environments

See [Models and Benchmarks Environment](/docs/envs/README.md) for detailed setup.

We **provide official environment requirements for all models and benchmarks**. While we recommend following these specifications, other versions may also work.

**Quick model environment verification:**

```python
# Demo
from ulmeval.config import supported_ULM
model = supported_ULM['Janus-Pro-1B']() # Input your model name here, according to ulmeval/config.py
ret = model.generate(['A close-up high-contrast photo of Sydney Opera House sitting next to Eiffel tower, under a blue night sky of roiling energy, exploding yellow stars, and radiating swirls of blue.'], num_generations=2)
ret[0].save('./assets/photo0.png')
ret[1].save('./assets/photo1.png')
```

## 🛠️ Development Guide

To develop custom benchmarks, ULMs, or other features to **ULMEvalKit**, please refer to [[Development_Guide](/docs/en/Development.md)].

**Call for contributions**

To promote the contribution from the community and share the corresponding credit (in the next report update):

- All Contributions will be acknowledged in the report.
- Contributors with **3 or more major contributions** (implementing an ULM/Generative Models, benchmark, or major feature) can join the author list of ULMEvalKit Technical Report (in progress).

**Eligible contributors:** create an issue or contact jdzcarr7@gmail.com.

Here is a [contributor list](/docs/en/Contributors.md) we curated based on the records.

## 🎯 The Goal of ULMEvalKit

**The codebase is designed to:**

1. **Easy-to-use evaluation**: Provide an opensource evaluation toolkit to make it convenient for researchers & developers to evaluate existing ULMs and generative models with reproducible results.
2. **Developer-friendly**: Enable ULM developers to evaluate their models on multiple benchmarks by implementing just a single `batch_generate_inner()` or `generate_inner()` function—all other workloads (data downloading, data preprocessing, prediction inference, metric calculation) are handled by the codebase.

**The codebase is not designed to:**

Reproduce the exact accuracy number reported in the original papers of all **3rd party benchmarks**, due to:
1. **Ramdomness factors:**
   + Different random seeds across models (we default to seed 42 for image generation)
   + Variable temperature settings when using large multimodal models (e.g., GPT-4o, Qwen2.5-VL) for scoring, which may not be consistently zero across papers
2. **Different Prompt Version.** By default, we use exactly the same prompt in the benchmark. However, some models may use a rewrite version ,e.g., BAGEL.

## 👍 Acknowledgement

ULMEvalKit is a fork of [VLMEvalKit](https://github.com/open-compass/VLMEvalKit). We follow its major structure and class definitions with key modifications:

+ Inference results saved as pickle files (instead of TSV) to include images
+ Judgers moved to `ulmeval/dataset/utils` to support various types: local models (CLIP, Mask2Former) and API models (GPT-4o)
+ Added distributed evaluation support for judgers
